audacious2 cue sheet system

This script serves as an alternative to audacious2's native cue sheet
support, which is not exactly gapless.
This script can list the tracks, identifying the currently played one
and also lets the user skip to the beginning of a track.
The cue sheet has to be in the same directory as the audio file, and
must be correctly matched to it with the FILE line.

The interface is interactive, press h for help.


I tried to make error checking as solid as possible.
Note to eval haters: this script makes use of it, and I did my best to
sanitize the string it executes. If you find any flaw, please contact
me.
